# OOP_Polynom
This is a Math project that contains various functions including class that represent a single Monom (ax^b) that has two variables
coefficient and power, and another class that represent Polynom which is a collection of Monoms that are saved in ArrayList which is
sorted from highest power to the lowest. Each of those classes has a different method such as adding two Monoms with the same power
,finding a derivative for a Polynom , multiply , equals , root , area etc.

# ComplexFunction has the folloing operators:
1.Times    
2.Plus    
3.Divid    
4.Max   
5.Min  
6.Comp   
7.None   

# The complex function can be represented by five ways:
1.An operator and two Complex Functions in parenthesis with a comma bitween them.           
2.An operator and a Complex Function or a Polynom or a Monom in parenthesis of ether side the comma.               
3.An operator and two Polynoms in parenthesis with a comma bitween them.            
4.An operator and two Monoms in parenthesis with a comma bitween them.               
5.An operator and a Polynom and a Monom in parenthesis of ether side the comma.
