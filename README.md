# OOP_Polynom
This is a Math project that contains various functions including class that represent a single Monom (ax^b) that has two variables
coefficient and power, and another class that represent Polynom which is a collection of Monoms that are saved in ArrayList which is
sorted from highest power to the lowest. Each of those classes has a different method such as adding two Monoms with the same power
,finding a derivative for a Polynom , multiply , equals , root , area etc.
# ComplexFunction has the folloing operators:
1.Times
2.Plus
3.Divid
4.Max
5.Min
6.Comp
7.None
# The comlex function can be represented by four ways:
An operator and two Complex Functions in parenthesis with a comma bitween them.
An operator and a Complex Function or a Polynom or a Monom in parenthesis of ether side the comma.
An operator and two Polynoms in parenthesis with a comma bitween them.
An operator and two Monoms in parenthesis with a comma bitween them.
An operator and a Polynom and a Monom in parenthesis of ether side the comma.
